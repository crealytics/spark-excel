# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue
with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

## Pull Request Process

1. Unless the changes are trivial extensions or bugfixes,
    please create an issue proposing what you want to change first.
2. After coordination with the project maintainers,
    go ahead and create the PR.
3. If you want to do larger refactorings that are not obviously necessary for the PR
     please coordinate with the project maintainers first.
     We're open to refactorings but would like to discuss and review them independently.
4. Auto-format your code using `sbt scalafmt test:scalafmt`.
5. Check the code with scalastyle using `sbt scalastyle test:scalastyle`
6. Update the `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` with details of changes to the interface.
7. Rebase your changes to the latest master in case something changed there.
